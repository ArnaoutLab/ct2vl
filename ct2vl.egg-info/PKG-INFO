Description: ct2vl.py is for use with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Covid-19) test on the Abbott m2000 system as validated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. If you want to use this at some other site or on/for some other system, you will want to be sure that efficiency falls linearly with Ct, and measure the appropriate constants. (If you want to customize further, please see the derivation of the math in the citation below.)
